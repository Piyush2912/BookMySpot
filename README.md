## 1. Motivation
- Need of organized parking system in malls.
- Due to huge number of cars in India, it raises a concern where to park when visiting any location.
- A fast and efficient approach needs to be developed to solve this issue.

## 2. Problem Statement
- Whenever we go out in the car to malls to fetch goods and supplies, or for any purpose, we find it difficult to find organized parking spots.
- The problem is the availability of a huge number of cars in a country like India, so there is a problem of parking and accommodation of parked vehicles.
- The goal of this project is to develop an organized website, so users can park their cars in a faster and efficient manner in organized and unorganized sectors.

## 3. Introduction
- It is well known to know the start, route, and endpoint in a journey when traveling in a car.
- It is a problem I faced myself because of many cars I could not find parking space for my car at right time, and time is valuable we do not want to waste it.
- The better we spent time the better our result will be, so I do not want that anyone would waste a lot of time in finding parking spots physically by looking here and there, which is why I want to make a website that could solve this problem.

## 4. Requirements
- Visual Studio Code version 1.5 or above.
- Node dependencies as provided in the code.
- MongoDB version 4.2 or above.
- System Requirements used in this project:
